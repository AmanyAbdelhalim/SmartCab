## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Goal of the Project
The goal of this machine learning project is apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.

### Achievements
- Investigated the environment the agent operates in by constructing a basic driving implementation.
- Identified each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection.
- Applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.
- Implemented a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time.
- Improved upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with satisfactory results.



### Install

This project was done using **Python 2.7** that already supports the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I installed the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included and I made sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer.
